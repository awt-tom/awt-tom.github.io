ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m [Tom Rolvers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomrolvers){:target="_blank"}, a Security Consultant at [yellow arrow](https://yellowarrow.nl/){:target="_blank"} in the Netherlands.

What started as a curiosity for Microsoft Security quickly turned into a passion, and now Iâ€™m fortunate enough to work with cutting-edge tools and technologies that help secure our digital world. At [yellow arrow](https://yellowarrow.nl/){:target="_blank"}, I specialize in Microsoft Security solutions, constantly exploring new ways to enhance security postures and mitigate threats. Along with that I have amazing colleagues to work with and make the online world a bit safer!

Beyond my daily work, I actively contribute to the Microsoft community. I enjoy participating in the Customer Connection Program, diving into Hack The Box challenges, and occasionally sharing insights through my blog. Additionally, I help organize the [Dutch Microsoft Security Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/Microsoft-Security-NL/?msockid=1b3e1ce10e706d8e002b08510fda6ce1){:target="_blank"}, bringing together Microsoft security professionals to exchange knowledge and experiences and have a great time together.

Always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute; whether itâ€™s through hands-on security research, writing, or community events. Letâ€™s connect!

ðŸ¤– Stay Secure! ðŸ¤–
