👋 Hi there! I'm [Tom Rolvers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomrolvers), a Security Consultant at [Yellow Arrow](https://yellowarrow.nl/) in the Netherlands. My journey with Microsoft Security products began as a hobby, evolved into a passion, and now fuels my career. I thrive on exploring new tools and techniques to enhance our digital security.

In my free time, I enjoy cycling 🚴, savoring beers and whiskeys 🍻, and diving into online challenges like Hack the Box and TryHackMe. I also dabble in malware analysis and homelabbing.

I created this blog to share my experiences with Microsoft products such as Defender, Sentinel, and Microsoft 365. My goal is to document my learning journey and share insights with you. After all, learning is one of life's greatest gifts—let's make the most of it! 😊

🤖 Stay Secure! 🤖
