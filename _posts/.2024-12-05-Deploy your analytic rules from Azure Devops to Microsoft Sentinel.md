## Connecting the Dots: Deploying to Sentinel

Now, let's connect everything to Sentinel:

1. Go to your main Sentinel instance.
2. Connect your DevOps repository (you'll need to set up a pipeline and give the necessary permissions, including write access on the artifact).
3. Set up a pipeline that runs a script to import these analytic rules.

Be ready—deploying rules isn't instant. Depending on the number of rules you're importing, deployment can take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes. You might even encounter some issues during deployment, like ERROR code 1. These can happen, but don’t worry—just troubleshoot, adjust, and retry as needed.
